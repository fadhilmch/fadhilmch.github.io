# TenisYuk

Static page, no build step. Served as-is by GitHub Pages.

- `index.html` - page shell
- `style.css` - styles (light and dark)
- `js/wordmarks.js` - logo images as data URIs
- `js/edits.js` - admin edits as pure functions (toggle paid, add, delete, undo, rollback)
- `js/money.js` - money math and recap text (pure functions, no DOM)
- `js/app.js` - screens, data loading and admin actions
- `config.js` - public Supabase URL and publishable key
- `tests/money.test.js`, `tests/edits.test.js` - tests for the money math, dates, who-owes card and edits

Run the tests (Node 18+, no install needed):

    cd tenisyuk && node --test tests/*.test.js

Rules the tests lock in: kas is 5 kr per person only; membership is billed minus the real booking only; the two are always separate.
